# 02 - Project Types

You may also specify the project type when creating it. Currently, two\
types are supported.

## 02.1 - Executable Project

This is the default. You don't need to explicitly tell cmaker to create an\
executable project.

```bash
cmaker -n my_project executable
```

## 02.2 - Library Project

To create the simplest library project, you should do as follows

```bash
cmaker -n my_library library
```

which will create a ``static`` library project.\

There are also other types of library projects:

### 02.2.1

```bash
cmaker -n my_library library -k static
```

```bash
cmaker -n my_library library -k shared

```bash
cmaker -n my_library library -k header-only
```
```
