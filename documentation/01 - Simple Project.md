# 01 - Simple Project

To create the simplest project, that is an C++ executable project, you do the following:

```bash
cmaker -n my_project
```

which will create the project in the current working directory.

If you want to create a C project instead, just pass the ``-l`` argument:

```bash
cmaker -n my_project -l c
```
